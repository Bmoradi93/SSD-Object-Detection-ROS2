# SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) Object Detection, ROS-Foxy Package #
In order to train your SSD model on your dataset, please refer to (https://github.com/Bmoradi93/SSD-Object-Detection-TFOD-Training-Pipeline)[SSD]

Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) is a CNN-based network architecture that was introduced by Liu et al in 2015 The bounding box regression algorithm has been taken from Googleâ€™s Inception Network. The SSD network is combined with bounding box regression to eliminate and replace the region proposal network that was used in Faster R-CNN network architecture. SSD is able to achieve Faster R-CNN accuracy and obtain 59+ fps.

SSD is capable of detecting multiple objects. Unlike R-CNN methods, it propagates the feature map in one forward pass throughout the network. This is the main reason that SSD is able to operate in real-time and handle object overlap in the data points. SSD uses a pre-trained network as a basic net which is trained on the ImageNet dataset. There are multiple convolutional layers and each one of them is individually and directly connected to the fully connected layer. A combination of SSD and bounding box regression allows the network to detect multiple objects with different scales.

In this repository, a real-time inference package is written in ROS-Foxy.
